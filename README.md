# CAR-BLACK-BOX-PROJECT

ABSTRACT:

Black Boxes are typically used in any transportation system (ex: Airplanes) that are used for analysis post-crash and understand the root cause of accidents. Continuous monitoring and logging of events (ex: over-speeding) is critical for effective usage of black box. The goal of this project is to implement core functionalities of a care black-box in a PIC based micro-controller supported by rich peripherals. Events will be logged in EEPROM in this project. This project can be further extended to any vehicle.

Applications:

1. Upon a catastrophe the Black Box is used to analyze the root cause of the issue.
2. As an extension of this idea, the data can be exported continuously to a Cloud based server where a centralized monitoring can be done
3. black box implementation is extendible as a IoT based solution as well
